    "#1-What is Simple Linear Regression?\n",
    " -> Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: one dependent variable (the             outcome) and one independent variable (the predictor). The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line that describes how changes in the     independent variable affect the dependent variable.Simple Linear Regression helps in predicting values, understanding relationships, and        identifying trends. It's widely used in economics, business, science, and many other fields."

    "    No Multicollinearity – Since Simple Linear Regression involves only one independent variable, this assumption mainly applies to multiple                             regression, but it's still good practice to check that 𝑋 is not highly correlated with another hidden factor."

    "#20-How can heteroscedasticity be identified in residual plots, and why is it important to address it?\n",
    "  -> Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of residuals in a regression model is not constant across all levels of the independent           variable(s). This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity, which is required for optimal ordinary least squares (OLS) regression          performance. Identifying and addressing heteroscedasticity is crucial to ensure reliable statistical inference.\n",
    "     How to Identify Heteroscedasticity in Residual Plots:\n",
    "     1-Scatterplot of Residuals vs. Predicted Values:Plot residuals (𝑌actual−𝑌predicted) against predicted values.If residuals fan out                                               (increase or decrease in spread) rather than staying consistent, heteroscedasticity is present.\n",
    "     2-Residuals vs. Independent Variables:If residual plots against specific predictors show a pattern or increasing/decreasing variance                                                instead of a random scatter, heteroscedasticity may be present.\n",
    "     3-Breusch-Pagan Test or White Test:These statistical tests formally detect heteroscedasticity by evaluating whether residual variance                                            systematically depends on predictors.\n",

    " -> When a Multiple Linear Regression model has a high 𝑅2 but low adjusted 𝑅2, it usually indicates that some predictors in the model do not     contribute much to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. Adjusted 𝑅2 corrects for the number of predictors included, so         when it's significantly lower than 𝑅2, it suggests that adding more variables might be inflating 𝑅2 without actually improving the           model's explanatory power.

    "#22-Why is it important to scale variables in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
    "  -> Scaling variables in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is crucial for ensuring stability, interpretability, and accuracy in the model.\n",
    "     1-Prevents Numerical Instability:When predictors have vastly different magnitudes (e.g., income in millions vs. age in years), the                                             regression algorithm may struggle to optimize coefficients efficiently.Scaling ensures that all                                               variables are on a similar scale, preventing rounding errors and numerical instability in computations.\n",
    "     2-Improves Interpretability of Coefficients: Without scaling, coefficients can be misleading—variables with larger units may appear more                                                   influential simply due to their scale.   Standardizing (e.g., using Z-scores) makes it                                                        easier to compare the relative importance of different predictors.\n",
    "     3-Mitigates Multicollinearity Issues:Some regularization techniques (like Ridge and Lasso Regression) penalize large coefficients, and                                             scaling ensures fair penalty application.When predictors are correlated, scaling can help mitigate                                            multicollinearity effects, leading to more stable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "     4- Essential for Gradient-Based Algorithms:If using models beyond traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression (such as Gradient                                                   Descent-based models), scaling is necessary for efficient convergence.  Algorithms like                                                      Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) perform poorly if variables have different scales."
